# Manual
1. We are giving starter codes for Vala. But if you used different language, feel free to override the whole repository.
2. When you accept the invite link, a separate fork repo will be created in your github space.
3. Clone the forked repo to your local computer
4. Create a readme which state your identity and add instruction in how to compile and run your program
5. Replace any sources with your codes manually by copy paste from your sources
6. Make commit and push to your repo
7. That's it, any commit you made will get notified in the master repo. Please do not make a pull request to the master.

Apologize for the delay, it's relatively hard to setup initial github classroom since the repo need to be configured in strictly specific condition.
